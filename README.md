# Statistical Modeling in R

## Description of Workshop

This workshop is part of the Summer Data Science Workshops hosted by Research Computing Services at Northwestern University (2019).

The purpose of the workshop is to introduce students in how to conduct statistical modeling with linear models, the most used generalized linear models, hierarchical linear models and survival analysis in R. This workshop will also include some exploratory data analysis and diagnostics.

Students are expected to have knowledge of R and regression analysis.


## Packages

This workshop requires packages: **pastecs, lm.beta, lmtest, foreign, lattice, lme4, nlme, survival, dplyr, ggfortify, survminer, rms, MASS.**

## Presentation

The presentations are available in the [**slides** directory](https://github.com/emiliolehoucq/stats-modeling-in-R/tree/master/slides).

## Downloading Files

### Recommended: Entire directory

You can download all of the files by clicking the green button above and choosing "Download ZIP."

### Individual Files

**If you download files from the links above, you have to click through to the RAW version of the R markdown files and download that.  If you download directly from the links above, the files won't open because they are web pages, not the raw files.**

### Downloading Exercises

To download just the exercise files, right-click on the links below, and choose Save Link As (or the similar option in your browser).  Make sure to choose All file types as the content type (or .ipynb if available), and remove any .txt or similar extensions from the file when you save it.  The files should be *.ipynb files, with no additional file type extensions.

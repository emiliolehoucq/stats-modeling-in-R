# Statistical Modeling in R

Emilio Lehoucq and Andre Archer

This workshop is part of the Summer Data Science Workshops hosted by Research Computing Services at Northwestern University (2019).

The purpose of the workshop is to introduce students in how to conduct statistical modeling with linear models, the most used generalized linear models, hierarchical linear models and survival analysis in R. This workshop will also include some exploratory data analysis and diagnostics.

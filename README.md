# Statistical Modeling in R

Emilio Lehoucq and Andre Archer

This workshop is part of the Summer Data Science Workshops hosted by Research Computing Services at Northwestern University (2019).

The purpose of the workshop is to introduce students in how to conduct statistical modeling with linear models, the most used generalized linear models, and hierarchical linear models in R, including some exploratory data analysis and diagnostics.

Students are expected to have knowledge of R and regression analysis.
